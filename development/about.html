                <h2 class="title">Our History</h2>
                <p>The original Sport Scope Endzone Camera was created for a local high school team after they could not afford the systems that were currently on the market. The owner of Sport Scope, with his entrepreneur nature, decided to create a new business selling high quality, but more affordable end zone camera systems. After having one of his best engineers from his primary business, Berg Companies, design and prototype an endzone camera, he decided to launch the business in 2011.</p>

<p>Our mission from the beginning was to provide sports programs of all sizes a quality, easy to use, and affordable end zone camera systems. We started by looking at all of our competitors and determined that their prices were too high, that their systems were too complex, and that their end zone camera packages were missing vital components. We set out to change the industry standards by offering the complete endzone camera package that is extremely easy to set up and use for an affordable price. We have always considered the customer and operator as the driving force behind everything we have done and will do.</p>

                <h2 class="title">About Our Endzone Camera</h2>
                <p>The first thing we focused on with our design was quality and cost. Our design is extremely simple, easy to fabricate, easy to build, and therefore much less expensive than the industry norm. With the extra savings from our design, we decided to include everything you would need to film and then some. This means our standard package comes with all the extended batteries, memory, cables, rain gear, etc. that is needed to film in any condition for 7-8 hrs. We also included a sports chair so the operator can sit down while they film. Sitting down during filming is possible with our system because the operator can control all the functions and movement of the camera from two remotes in the control area.</p>

<p>The next important part of our endzone camera system was how to control the camera's movements.  We use our customized automatic pan tilt head and joystick remote to control the movement of the camera in tandem with a small Sony remote that controls the camera's functions like zoom in/out and record. The quality construction, easy set up, and smooth operation makes Sport Scope Endzone Camera the best way to get elevated film and will help your team rise above the competition.</p>
