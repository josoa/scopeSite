                                Each Sport Scope endzone camera comes standard with a 32 GB memory card that will hold 8 hrs or HD video. The best thing about using a memory card is that they are extremely versatile, easy to use, and durable. Each football coach or each sport can have their own memory card, so the camcorder is never needed to watch the video you record, which always leaves the endzone camera available for use. Memory cards quickly transfer video to your computer, which can then uploaded to your editing software, such as, Hudl or can be made into DVDs for coaches, parents, and players. Flash memory card camcorders are much more durable than internal hard drive camcorders because they do not contain moving parts than can be easily damaged from even small vibrations.

                                <p>The Sport Scope's pan/tilt joystick is unique to the endzone camera industry. The operator can control the movement of the camera with an easy to use joystick instead of manually moving the entire tower left and right and using a lever to move the camera up and down. Our joystick also allows the operator to control the speed of the pan and the speed on the tilt individually for a truly customized filming experience. The versatility in speed control also allows our endzone camera to be used more effectively with different sports. You can slow down the speed of the pan/tilt for a slow paced sport or speed it up for a fast paced sport.
