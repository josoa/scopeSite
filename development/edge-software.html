Using the speed control meter at the top of the app, you can play each video clip in slow motion and fast forward, both in play and paused modes for simple control. The custom controls of the EDGE App allow forward and rewind with ergonomically positioned thumb buttons over the video player or the play can be scrubbed back and forth using the progress bar feature. Additionally, the play number is positioned in the top left-hand corner so you can quickly see exactly which play you're viewing.</p>

      <p>The EDGE App comes with many built in smart features that save coach's time and allow them to fully use EDGE Instant Replay to find and exploit their opponent's weaknesses.  One of those features is the ability to quickly sort through clips based on the tagged information assigned to each play.  This allows each coach to tailor the EDGE App to their coaching position and style.  Offensive, defensive, and special teams coaches and filter the plays that matter the most to them, which eliminates clutter and gets them viewing the most valuable plays to quickly see what adjustments need to be made.  Coaches can also save certain plays to their iPad and bring them into the locker room to show their players during half time.  This can be done without being connected to the wireless network because the plays are saved to the device.</p>

   The Edge replay system was an awesome asset to our team as we used it every day in practice to analyze our QB's mechanics as well as the play of the offensive line. During our games, the coaching staff was constantly sitting down with our players on the sideline and breaking down the film so that we could make the proper adjustments in our schemes.

   We were able to utilize the EDGE Instant Replay as immediate feed back for our players.  We two platoon in our program and the EDGE is a tool we use to coach between series.  This allowed clear communication with our players and allowed all coaches to be on the same page throughout the game. The EDGE was accessible during the game and our players were able to view their mistakes, making corrections more efficient.
