                            The Sport Scope is a quality, easy to use, and affordable end zone camera system that is used by coaches to safely record their players from heights up to 30 ft. to enhance how they see what is happening on the field in order to better coach their players. End zone cameras are primarily used as a football video camera, but are also great  for many other sports that demand great footage of their players, such as, football, soccer, rugby, baseball, and lacrosse.

                            The Sport Scope is superior to other endzone camera systems on the market for four main reasons:
                            1) Quality. The Sport Scope was designed by an accomplished engineer who designs remote site camps for the military. The design is simple, easy to use, and rugged. Sport Scope’s endzone cameras are also manufactured in the USA and by a company that is ISO certified. This means that each Sport Scope passes a quality management system before it is shipped.
                            2) Ease of Use. The Sport Scope and all its components were packaged together to provide the best experience for the customer. Set up time is 5 min. and operation is a breeze with our fully automatic custom controls.
                            3) Complete System. The Sport Scope is the only endzone camera system that comes with everything you need. Our travel bag houses all your components, which include important extras like rain gear, ground stakes, sports chair, extended battery, extended memory, and memory card reader.
                            4) Price. At $4499 the Sport Scope can't be beat. Other systems cost from $5,400 up to $8,800 and are either manually controlled or missing many important components.

                         The Sport Scope comes with a custom made joystick to easily control the pan and tilt of the camera.  The joystick also comes with two speed knobs, one controls the speed for the panning and the other for the tilting.  The speed knobs allow the operator to calibrate the speed to fit which sport they are filming.                           </div>

The third is 4 (9v) batteries located inside the joystick or pan tilt head, depending on the model, that powers the pan/tilt head and will last 20+ football games and can be easily changed.
