                                The Sony camera remote allows the user to zoom in and out as they record with their endzone camera. You can also turn on / off the camcorder with this remote, which means you can conserve battery during halftime, between quarters, etc. The user can also put the camcorder in record or standby mode, allowing for the operator to only record the plays they want. This allows for smaller, more precise clips of only the action in the plays, which cuts down on transfer and analysis time.

Our durable design allows the operator to comfortably control the movement of the camcorder at variable speeds. Other automatic endzone cameras use off the shelf pan / tilt heads that are made for still photography and not for fast paced sports like football. Sport Scope's joystick remote is also unique to the endzone camera market and allows for easy, precise control of what the operator is filming.

                                The Sport Scope 30' or 25' and all accessories fit inside the portable travel bag. The bag is made of ballistic nylon and is padded on all sides, which prevents damage during transportation. Some end zone cameras either do not come with a travel bag or they come with several, which makes the process of moving the end zone camera much more complicated. The Sport Scope's wheel plate also connects to the bag making transportation a breeze even through thick grass and mud. Other system's bags either come with small plastic wheels or with no wheels at all, which makes transporting the end zone camera much more difficult.

                                The Sport Scope comes standard with ground stakes that stake through each leg's foot. The ground stakes ensure that the endzone camera tower will not fall over in windy conditions. If you play on turf you can place sandbags on each foot of the endzone camera.
