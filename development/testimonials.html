				I am very pleased with both the service and product from Sport Scope Endzone Camera. My former high school will greatly benefit by having a state-of-the-art endzone camera tripod. As a professional football player, I know how important it is to be able to obtain multiple video angles of each play to better analyze technique and scheme. The Sport Scope delivers just that: crystal clear video from a great vantage point.

			Sport Scope's endzone camera provided us with great information that a sideline camera can't! Our offensive line coach used this view only for his time with the players. Our running backs really enjoyed watching the endzone view of games as it provided valuable feedback on their performance. Not only did we use the Sport Scope endzone video system for both home and away games, we used it for our daily practices. It is so nice to have a camera that is very mobile and can also be used in bad weather. I can't imagine not having it!

			The Sport Scope was definitely a part of our success as we had a school record 12 win season. The amount of coaching we were able to do through a great view from the end zone system in games AND practice tripled compared to years past. Our players could finally see their mistakes and it helped us improve throughout the year. The camera and tower were easy to use, quick to set up, and we had zero problems all year. It’s been a great product.

			When we began looking into an end zone camera system, Sport Scope was recommended to my by a friend who is an athletic director and football coach for a team we play against every season. He had nothing but good things to say about the system and especially the service they provide. After using it this fall, I have to agree with him. The system is easy to set up, operate, and take down. Our video quality is excellent and it works well with our video editing system. We have also been extremely happy with their customer service and the way they worked with us to make sure we were comfortable using the system. I highly recommend Sport Scope and their systems.

			The <a href="./sport-scope-30.html">30' Sport Scope</a> was a tremendous asset to our team this fall. The end zone view allowed us to better correct and implement schemes which greatly helped during our run to the state championship this season. Without this technology, I don't think we would have been as prepared or efficient as a team. I can't speak highly enough of our experience and the benefit it had on our program; the Sport Scope truly was a game changer.

			Sport Scope Endzone Camera System is an invaluable part of our football operations. End zone shots and film captured during practice is vital to recruiting and a great teaching tool for our program. We've had it for two years now and the customer service has been phenomenal. We ordered a replacement part and it was shipped immediately so we could receive it on Thursday in time for our Friday game. I highly recommend Sport Scope and you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't find a way to purchase one for your program.

			We love our Sport Scope Endzone Camera System. We utilize that view every week to determine blocking schemes and it's instrumental in making our lineman better. The best experience though was the customer service we have received from Sport Scope, especially Dixie Zieglar. Not only did we receive our equipment in a timely manner, Dixie repeatedly checked in with us to make sure everything was going well and to wish us luck in our upcoming games. We wouldn't use anyone else!

			We are very pleased with the quality and reliability of our Sport Scope Endzone Camera System. It goes up easily and is user friendly. We have used it in bright sun, rain, and high winds. Any questions or issues with our system are quickly resolved by Sport Scope. We would strongly recommend the Sport Scope System to other coaches. We feel that our endzone view gives us a big advantage over our competitors. We can better observe our opponents' splits, shades, blocking schemes, and reads. Coaches and players feel prepared and know what to expect. Our endzone shots are an excellent tool for teaching proper technique. It is great for observing hand, foot, head, and shoulder movement. We often use our <a href="quick-scope-11.html">11' Coach's Pole</a> on scouting trips for sideline views, especially for schools that do not have high bleachers. It is much easier to tape the game using he Coach's Pole than a handheld camcorder.

			The Sport Scope Endzone Camera has been an indispensable resource for our football program these past two football seasons. We use it every day during the week for practice and on Friday night games. The views we get from the endzone video system allow us to make corrections throughout the week and after games. I believe our system was crucial to our dominant offensive and defensive line play this past season, our 15-0 record, and 4A State Championship. The equipment is very user-friendly and we are able to put the system up or take it down in a very time efficient manner. The tech support from Sport Scope has also been amazing. I would recommend this company and their system to any team looking for an endzone camera system.

			At Coldwater High School, we invested in your Sport Scope Endzone Camera this year. At this point, we used it for games only, but we found it as a huge benefit and teaching tool for our team. For our interior O/D lineman and the linebackers, the endzone view is awesome. We can split our film review and get the best look for or lineman while the skill players can use the pressbox tripod view for their film study. Once we figured out how to set it up and use it, it was a 10 minute process to get it up and running. Hopefully other sports at our school will find it beneficial.
