				I am very pleased with both the service and product from Sport Scope Endzone Camera. My former high school will greatly benefit by having a state-of-the-art endzone camera tripod. As a professional football player, I know how important it is to be able to obtain multiple video angles of each play to better analyze technique and scheme. The Sport Scope delivers just that: crystal clear video from a great vantage point.

			Sport Scope's endzone camera provided us with great information that a sideline camera can't! Our offensive line coach used this view only for his time with the players. Our running backs really enjoyed watching the endzone view of games as it provided valuable feedback on their performance. Not only did we use the Sport Scope endzone video system for both home and away games, we used it for our daily practices. It is so nice to have a camera that is very mobile and can also be used in bad weather. I can't imagine not having it!

			The Sport Scope was definitely a part of our success as we had a school record 12 win season. The amount of coaching we were able to do through a great view from the end zone system in games AND practice tripled compared to years past. Our players could finally see their mistakes and it helped us improve throughout the year. The camera and tower were easy to use, quick to set up, and we had zero problems all year. It’s been a great product.

			When we began looking into an end zone camera system, Sport Scope was recommended to my by a friend who is an athletic director and football coach for a team we play against every season. He had nothing but good things to say about the system and especially the service they provide. After using it this fall, I have to agree with him. The system is easy to set up, operate, and take down. Our video quality is excellent and it works well with our video editing system. We have also been extremely happy with their customer service and the way they worked with us to make sure we were comfortable using the system. I highly recommend Sport Scope and their systems.

			The <a href="./sport-scope-30.html">30' Sport Scope</a> was a tremendous asset to our team this fall. The end zone view allowed us to better correct and implement schemes which greatly helped during our run to the state championship this season. Without this technology, I don't think we would have been as prepared or efficient as a team. I can't speak highly enough of our experience and the benefit it had on our program; the Sport Scope truly was a game changer.

			Sport Scope Endzone Camera System is an invaluable part of our football operations. End zone shots and film captured during practice is vital to recruiting and a great teaching tool for our program. We've had it for two years now and the customer service has been phenomenal. We ordered a replacement part and it was shipped immediately so we could receive it on Thursday in time for our Friday game. I highly recommend Sport Scope and you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't find a way to purchase one for your program.

			We love our Sport Scope Endzone Camera System. We utilize that view every week to determine blocking schemes and it's instrumental in making our lineman better. The best experience though was the customer service we have received from Sport Scope, especially Dixie Zieglar. Not only did we receive our equipment in a timely manner, Dixie repeatedly checked in with us to make sure everything was going well and to wish us luck in our upcoming games. We wouldn't use anyone else!

			We are very pleased with the quality and reliability of our Sport Scope Endzone Camera System. It goes up easily and is user friendly. We have used it in bright sun, rain, and high winds. Any questions or issues with our system are quickly resolved by Sport Scope. We would strongly recommend the Sport Scope System to other coaches. We feel that our endzone view gives us a big advantage over our competitors. We can better observe our opponents' splits, shades, blocking schemes, and reads. Coaches and players feel prepared and know what to expect. Our endzone shots are an excellent tool for teaching proper technique. It is great for observing hand, foot, head, and shoulder movement. We often use our <a href="quick-scope-11.html">11' Coach's Pole</a> on scouting trips for sideline views, especially for schools that do not have high bleachers. It is much easier to tape the game using he Coach's Pole than a handheld camcorder.

			The Sport Scope Endzone Camera has been an indispensable resource for our football program these past two football seasons. We use it every day during the week for practice and on Friday night games. The views we get from the endzone video system allow us to make corrections throughout the week and after games. I believe our system was crucial to our dominant offensive and defensive line play this past season, our 15-0 record, and 4A State Championship. The equipment is very user-friendly and we are able to put the system up or take it down in a very time efficient manner. The tech support from Sport Scope has also been amazing. I would recommend this company and their system to any team looking for an endzone camera system.

			At Coldwater High School, we invested in your Sport Scope Endzone Camera this year. At this point, we used it for games only, but we found it as a huge benefit and teaching tool for our team. For our interior O/D lineman and the linebackers, the endzone view is awesome. We can split our film review and get the best look for or lineman while the skill players can use the pressbox tripod view for their film study. Once we figured out how to set it up and use it, it was a 10 minute process to get it up and running. Hopefully other sports at our school will find it beneficial.

			If I had to list 5 things we did this year that played a part in our success and our ability to win a state championship, the amount of film we were able to watch as a staff and team would be up there.  Not only were we able to film the wide, but we also filmed the endzone every practice regardless of weather with our Sport Scope Endzone Camera.  Daily practice corrections were sent to each position group from both film angles allowing the players to see the "little" things that needed correcting.  The Sport Scope was so easy to set up and manage that we were able to put a student assistant in charge of operating it everyday.  Their customer service is outstanding, and we thank them for all their help this season!

			Our players and coaches alike have loved what the Sport Scope system has brought to our team.  Having an endzone view of every game, not just the home games, was instrumental to our success this year.  As an offensive line coach, having a view that shows exactly what was going on was a tremendous tool.  The system itself is incredibly easy to use.  After a couple of practices, our student managers and film guy were able to set up and take down with ease and simplicity.  Our soccer teams have used this in the spring and we used it as the backup finish line camera for a state qualifying track meet last spring.  Customer service has been exceptional in responding to some early questions we had.  Overall, I would highly recommend Sports Scope for their exceptional product and fantastic customer service. I truly believe this was a big part of our success this year!

			Just thought I'd keep you up to date with the camera. Absolutely loving it! I was out filming Friday, Saturday, and Sunday this weekend filming Rugby and Soccer matches. Nothing beats having it set up and sitting back filming with the monitor in my lap. It certainly turns heads and I get a lot of questions about it. The footage looks amazing. Wish I had it years ago instead of filming from a tripod at head height. I'm looking to do a lot of freelance filming for various clubs and set up my own website to advertise my services. Thank you!

			I want to take a moment to let you know how happy I, my coaching staff and my team are with our camera. The endzone view is priceless as a coach for finding out what is going right and what is going wrong. The kids were a little less enthusiastic at first, because nothing is hidden (right or wrong) on each play. Mistakes are right out there for everyone to see. They are coming around quickly to the fact that the endzone view is a great tool to be used by everyone on the team. The Dayton Dust Devils are loving this system. It is easy to set up and use and the uploads are fast and simple. Your staff was amazing and all of your help was appreciated more than you know. I hope you have great success with your business in the future. I will be your greatest salesman in my little corner of the world. I will encourage anyone who asks to look into getting a system from Sport Scope.

			Our Sport Scope endzone camera was a very useful tool in us winning the 4A State Championship.  As valuable as the end zone shots were, it was probably more valuable in our daily filming of practice.  We could shoot practice and load it easily into our editing program and have our coaches and players watch the film.  It was extremely valuable and an easy to use addition to our program.

			Our Sport Scope End Zone Camera has changed our approach in practice and games dramatically.  We can now coach "on the run" better and get better practice film.  Our games are "checkerboarded" and we save a lot of time analyzing film.  The Hi-def camera is awesome and we are buying a new Hi-def camera for our sideline view just because the Sport Scope is so much clearer.  We are extremely happy with our purchase.  The cost was lower than the other companies we looked at, and the quality is outstanding.  We are the envy of our league and we recommend Sport Scope very highly.

			I like the Sport Scope Endzone system because it is easy to use and easy to set up for practice and games.  It gives us a great view from behind the ball that we like to use for teaching our players proper technique.  Sport Scope is also quick to answer any questions you may have about your initial set up concerns.  Once we got a routine with the set up procedures, it was really easy. I also found Sport Scope End Zone Camera to be the best quality and price of any other endzone camera systems that I was able to view.  We have a couple other teams in the area that use other brands and I was not impressed with the quality of the towers they used.  Without a doubt, the best price and best quality product for an endzone camera system is Sport Scope.  I highly recommend Sport Scope Endzone system to anybody looking to upgrade their video program.

			Our football program has never had an end zone camera.  We used the put a coach in the lift with a camera and expected good results.  This last year we decided to invest in an end zone camera.  After calling around we decided on Sport Scope.  We felt comfortable with their customer service and most importantly their product.  Once our camera arrived, our coaches looked curiously at the camera as I started to unpack it.  Within 15 minutes we had the whole thing set up and ready, not bad for coaches who had never used this type of system before.  Now we can set up and tear down in less than 5 minutes.  During shipping one of the wheels was bent.  I called customer service and without hesitation or question, they shipped us a new wheel.  Once we got the hang of everything we taped a lot of practice from special teams, 7 on 7, inside run, and team.  The next day in meetings we watched our practice.  Our kids made more improvements from watching the tape.  The mistakes they would make the day before were eliminated the next day because of the film we got from our Sport Scope.  This year we will tape freshman-varsity so they can continue to learn and get better.  We had the best record at our school since 1982!  Sports Scope was an integral part!  Thanks!

			I have had many years of experience videotaping for our football program.  I was given the responsibility of purchasing an end zone camera system.  Based on features, cost, and ease of set-up, we purchased the Sport Scope system.  Our coaches have found the system to be easy to set up and take down.  We have not experienced any difficulty with the electronics of the system and our operator finds it easy to use.  Best of all, the coaches have been very pleased with HD video quality.

			I am very satisfied with the endzone camera system we received from Sport Scope. The system is very easy to set up and move around thanks to the carrier. Also they provide everything from a chair to sit in to the water proof cover for the camera.

			We have been using a variety of cameras to records games for our club teams, including handhelds, small tripod based systems, and paying third parties to record games at significant costs. We have found that using the Endzone Camera by Sport Scope has provided our club with both a learning tool for our teams, and a way to showcase talent to college recruiters that produce high quality videos with an eagle eyes view of the action.

			We are using it each day to film our coaches and players during spring practices. It is great to move it around the field to different drill areas and film. When we review the film, we get a great look from above the drill, great teaching tool!
